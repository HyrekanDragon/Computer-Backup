# Facebook API
Facebook requires user authorization before they grant access to their API and use it to retrieve or publish data. Usually this is done by first creating a Facebook application, then using the application's credentials to request access to a user's account.

Specifically, an application opens a browser window and asks a user to log in. The login process ends with returning an access token. Your application uses the access token to retrieve the authenticated user's information or publish information to their account.

# API Explorer
Facebook's API explorer allows you to test retrieving and positing information through the different endpoints Facebook provides wihtout the need of developing a Facebook application or coding. Remember you will need to create an application to programmatically access the API.
