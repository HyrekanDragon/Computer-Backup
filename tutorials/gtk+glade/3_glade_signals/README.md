# Signals
Events in gtkmm often send what are called signals that can be caught by special methods. Examples of signals include button clicks, mouse movement, keyboard clicks, and so forth. Signal handlers are often used to map signals to functions that are called when certain signals are caught.

In this particular example, the signal handler waits for a mouse click event and calls a corresponding function.
